## My ssh-portfolio

Thought it could be interesting to create a portfolio ssh-server, where a viewer could
access it and view my skills, projects, and how to contact me etc.

I'm using these modules:
```
"github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"
"github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss"
"github.com/charmbracelet/ssh"
"github.com/charmbracelet/wish"
"github.com/charmbracelet/wish/bubbletea"
```
